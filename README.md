# Arduino Rotator Controlbox

## Library dependencies

[**UTFT**](http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=51) – A universal library that supports a large number of display modules and controllers

[**UTFT_Geometry**](http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=59) – Adds some geometric functions to UTFT library

Both need to be installed in your Arduino compiler library directory.

## Compilation

In order to compile and install this project, you need to edit create a configuration file (**Settings.h**). You can find a sample configuration provided with the project (**Settings_sample.h**).

ARC is still a WIP and currently developed and tested on an **ATMega 2560** only.
